# odin8

This is a simple Chip8 emulator written in Odin as an exercise in both emulation and low level programming.

## Compile
Make sure you have the Odin compiler set up and visible in your `PATH`. [See here for more info.](https://odin-lang.org/docs/install/)

`$ make`

`$ ./odin8 ./programs/maze.ch8`

See the `programs` folder for other available programs.

## TODOs
- [ ] Add support for keyboard input
- [ ] Add support for the delay timer
- [ ] Add support for the sound timer
- [x] ~~Add support for importing your own program instead of having the maze hardcoded~~
